# MARS-analysis
Module 11 Challenge

This is an analysis of Mars Temperature data based on data scraped from the Mars Temperature Data Site. Two starter code Jupyter notebook files were used as part of the analysis.

How many months exist on Mars?

12

How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

1867

What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 

On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. To visualize this answer see the bar charts below:

Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth month.

About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 

Here is a visual estimation generated by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
